## Game Concept

**Fahrkarten bitte!** is a short-session, single-player decision-making game set inside a train carriage.  
The player takes the role of a ticket inspector and must inspect as many passengers as possible within a strict five-minute time window between stations. Each interaction presents moral dilemmas: passengers may lack valid tickets for understandable reasons, forcing the player to balance efficiency, empathy, and institutional rules under time pressure.

The game was developed as part of a university project on **emotional accessibility**, aiming to investigate how stress, ambiguity, and player choice can be scaled without relying on explicit violence or graphic content.

## Core Mechanics

Gameplay is structured around repeated **station-to-station loops**:
- Players select passengers directly in the carriage view.
- Each inspection opens a dialog-based interaction with multiple-choicechoice-driven responses.
- At any point, the player must decide whether to allow the passenger to stay or eject them from the train.
- All decisions contribute to a final summary that evaluates consistency, strictness, and alignment with company goals.

The game emphasizes:
- **Time management** under pressure  
- **Meaningful player choice** with social consequences  
- **Narrative ambiguity** rather than binary right-or-wrong outcomes

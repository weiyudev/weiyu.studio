## Project Overview

Players interact via the command line, using monsters and actions defined in an external configuration file to run “competitions”. Each monster has stats such as HP and speed. Actions can deal damage, heal, apply status conditions (e.g. poison, slow), or modify stats. The project includes a complete battle flow controller, random number system, and command handling layer, so new monsters and actions can be added by editing configuration files rather than changing core logic. Details in the GitHub repository.
